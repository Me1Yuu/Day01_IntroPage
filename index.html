    <p>I lost my passion/motivation for coding... But I don't want that so I searched for daily challenges or ANY challenges I can do per day to get into coding again. <br>
    But I only found online challenges where they have already an inbuild visual studio code (well I don't mind that too) Currently I am registered in Codedamn to do some daily challenges on their website. <br>
    But I needed tasks: Someone says what to do for todays practice and that's it. <br>
    And then I rememebered that an AI like ChatGPT might be able to do such a thing. So I am testing it out and will see how far I can get with it.</p>
