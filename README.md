A 30 Days Challenge created by ChatGPT

07.05.2025
Today I start with a 30 days challenge, created from ChatGPT because I wanted to try it out how far I can get with an AI.
AND I also wanted to come back with coding... because I lost all my motivation for it... But I don't want to lose it because I really do love coding...
This challenge is only for HTML/CSS/JS. I start with HTML only and slowly do CSS and then JS.
